# GraphQL Restaurant Exercise

## Description of the project:

This project demonstrates how GraphQL aims to simplify the complexities of maintaining multiple API endpoints to handle different data operations by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it.

## How to Run:

Download the files making sure they are in the same folder, they have the same file names and run the command "npm install" in the terminal while in the root directory and then run command "node index.js". Open a browser and enter "http://localhost:5500/graphql."

## Roadmap of future improvements:

Future improvements would be to add more art to the page and/or even more eyes. I would add an image in the background to make it seem like the eyes are on a creature or animal or person. Also changing the image of the eyes to be more realistic.
